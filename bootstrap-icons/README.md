## DNB Hugo Libs / Bootstrap Icons

This is a Hugo theme component adding [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

### Usage

This module adds a content page at http://localhost:1313/dnb/bootstrap-icons/ that shows an overview of all available icons and their code.

Call these icons as partials:

```gotemplate
{{ partialCached "bsicon" "arrow-right" "arrow-right" }}
```

### Installing

Step 1: Make sure that modules are enabled in your own repository. If there is no `go.mod` in your root directory run the following command and use a descriptive name. Typically, the repository-path without protocol in the beginning serves this purpose.

```shell script
hugo mod init github.com/username/reponame
```

Step 2: add the module to your required modules in `config.toml` or `config/module.toml`

```toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/dnb-hugo/libraries/bootstrap-icons"
```

The next time you run hugo it will download the latest version of the module.
